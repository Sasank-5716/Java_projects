# Number Guessing Game (Java Swing)
A simple and interactive Number Guessing Game built with Java Swing. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, providing helpful feedback and a celebratory animation when the correct number is guessed.

## Features

- Feedback on guesses:

    - "Too high" / "Too low"

    - "Little high" / "Little low" (if within 5 of the target)

- Winner animation: Colorful flashing and celebratory text when the correct number is guessed.

- Input validation: Ensures only numbers between 1 and 100 are accepted.
